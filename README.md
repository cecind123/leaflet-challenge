In this assignment, I visualize earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey. From the USGS, I am working with "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days" data. It is given in a JSON representation of that data.

I create my site and map using HTML/CSS/JS, Leaflet, and d3 to plot all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.
The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color. The map includes popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
